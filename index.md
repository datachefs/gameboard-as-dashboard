Site for exploring using game boards as a metaphor for dashboards. .

In the first page of the pilot,  this site will be used to  play around with the mechanics for  My So-Called (Work) Life.


NOTES:
- This pilot project is part of Data Chefs
- Yes, I know  this page's header image doesn't go with the metaphor of the game board; it's a (pretty) placeholder till I find have time to find an alternative
