# Overview

## Key Decisions So Far

Platform: Streamlit

First project: a simple transform tool for simple  migrations into a new platform


## What I’m Playing With

- More generic framework:
	- One or more “boards” — eg, for Our New Home, a super simple, code-generated floor plan 
	- Use the boards to make moves that generate one or more recipes



## Where I’m Struggling

### Mixed Metaphors

For analytics engineering coding, 
I like the metaphor of recipes and cooking.

And for coming up with it with the recipes,
I like the metaphor of game boards and moves.

But… Mixed Metaphors!  


## Playful vs Gimmicky

When is being playful 
just window dressing?

And when would it 
change the way we think
and open up the field?
