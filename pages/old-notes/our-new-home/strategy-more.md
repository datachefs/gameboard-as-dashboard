Rather than writing down bits and pieces of notes everywhere — or worse yet, rummaging around for code — I have a structured way to 
- Quickly dump unstructured stuff
- Easily turn it into either 
	- recipe steps for a particular cuisine
	- Semantic knowledge and links 
	- User stories for a library recipe step (ingredients?)(novice users need this too — “remember I wanna make brownie in a cup” only it’s Excel style trick)
	- Something that pushes you towards refactoring??  (EZ unit testing?)

Almost like a cross between a Knowledge base and a hackable EZ Bake Oven and a mix tape, 
plus glitter

Fun, playful — the anti-caster (spell caster?)
(What would caster recipes look like if they were fun, and had puppies and kitties?)
(Ask online: if I build a few methods on top, will it noticeably slow down faster so long as lightweight?)

Do this for my finance “recipes”, too?  So I gradually build 
- my estimated tax documentation
- Next possible steps to try to automate / make easier

Also sudoku-like pieces of the puzzle / possible rules/heuristics/solution-goals, like how much voice I can do when I do lots of talking in meetings and teaching class
