## What I Want to Accomplish

### Big Goals
 
 - Take good care of my hands and voice
 - Be happier, more playful, more curiosity during the day
 - Keep leveling up -- and do it in a way that feels fun-hard, not super anxiety provoking, where I have to work at it and it can be frustrating and challenging, but I don't constantly dread it (only occasionally :-) )
 - Create a Proof of Concept / Minimally Viable Product where Gordon, Rumi, account executives, Matt Burry, etc. could see how this could turn into a service for our slightly more adventurous clients

NOTE: once I've got a quick and dirty top sheet, flesh out what the MVP would need to do to convince folks that an approach like this could help our clients and turn a profit.


### Secondary Goals

 - Get more comfortable using data to drive my decisions around my hands and voice
 - Have a short task list every day that keeps me focused
 - Make progress most weeks without feeling guilty
 - Have a to do list and hands-voice tracker that feel fun to play with rather than making me anxious
