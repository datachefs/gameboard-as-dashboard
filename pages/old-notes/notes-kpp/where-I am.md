 ## Where I Am

 So, on the way home from a big party,
there ships sank and they got swamped
and now all they have is a tiny schooner, some catnip, three stale bagels that are soggy, and some rum

So let's start with coveting.
- I like the idea of building up resources -- rum, stale bagels, catnip, casks of milk, fronds that you can weave into new sails, etc.- so you can build better, faster ships.
- Or better stale bagel detectors, because bits of bagel you find lying outside that are at least a week old have magical powers-- as anyone who's paid enough attention when taking walks with dogs knows.

So I have

- __Coveting__:  New ships, bigger ships, and more features for the ships / upgrading ships
- __Gathering/Earning__:  Rum, stale bagels, catnip, casks of milk, fronds to weave into new sails, etc.
- Exploring


I also know that each day I need opportunities for winning new resources
- the tension between winning points for doing a few things right
- vs winning points for not doing something the entire day (or putting it in a positive light: for doing something the entire day, like eating healthy, or eating only when I'm hungry)

But then there's how do I ensure I get my work done
- the idea of slots
- of saying:
  - I'm going to voice here
  - use my hands here
  - read/watch/coach here
- and keeping track of my franticness

this is what I need to work on next:
- not solving the problem -- it's too early for that
- but just better defining what the problem _is_
  

To avoid:
- I DM someone a question at a time where I'm going to have to respond a bunch, and I don't have any typing or voice time to do it (getting too anxious to slow down and take care of myself)
- instead of following Gordon's rule, I keep sending slack's
- I sit for a meeting, then I keep sitting when I've got a chance to lie down, then I've got another meeting
- I get too frenzied and can't stop typing
- I get an email from a client, and I respond right away or frantically look for an answer when I'm out of typing/voice time
- I keep hurting myself the same way over and over -- I don't document it so I can learn from it, don't analyze it, etc.

NOTE: need to flesh out this list, so I can better identify the behaviors I want to avoid

To encourage each day:
- scheduling up my time in blocks
- sticking at least roughly to the blocks: maybe I win points for each time I do it
- when I start to veer out of control, winning points for catching it and stopping/letting go
- mini-meditations throughout the day
- identifying my mistakes, looking for patterns and causes (mining my experience)
- gathering more data about identifying tactical problems, habit loops, etc.
- noticing when my body is tight when I am doing voice recognition (maybe that's another mini-quest / dismantling a habit loot?)

Habit loot?

What are the mechanics for scheduling my day?
- Put a coin/wooden block on a time slot?
- Put a word on the slot?
  - I could even have a pile of the ones I'm going to use regularly
  - I could have either a Queue of the words for an individual project, or they could be buried treasure on an island -- only instead of being hidden, I can see which ones they are, with the top 5 or 8 are scattered across an island
    - I could win 1-3 rums/stale bagel pieces /etc. depending on how well I think I did

To encourage each week:   
Making a tiny bit of progress   
example:
- starting back with my voice exercises
- automating some work
- better voice commands for Slack
- asking Gordon what reasonable expectation is for minimum time to reply to email
- thinking sentences through my head before speaking them, so I can speak in a more PT voice friendly way

Maybe as mini-quests?

Tracking
-  my anxiety level
- my pain in my arms and knees
- how good my voice feels

Maybe I
- earn points each time they go below a certain threshold?   
- earn points per day where I take care of myself
- lose points on days when a "storm" hits and I don't "batten down the hatches"?
  - Do it in a way that doesn't make me beat up on myself, that acknowledges that there will be ebbs and flows, that part of the way I learned to get better is by making mistakes, so I shouldn't get penalized for them
- earn points for the overall pattern of a week? A month? A quarter?
