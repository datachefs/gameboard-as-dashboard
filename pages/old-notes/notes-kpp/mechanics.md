## Mechanics I Like

 - I like coveting -- e.g., saving up to buy more/better features for a spacecraft
 - Something whimsical? Like with teddy bears and kittens and puppies? Teddy bears and puppies as pirates or see-faring explorers?

- If I know I’m not going to be perfect, or have a perfect marriage or perfect friendships, how do I start to use meditation, etc to start looking at the feelings behind my urge at one moment to overeat, and use them to start building more healthy feelings so I can let go of overeating? puppy&kitten Pirates: what looks like in that moment? The hard, “heroic” struggle (training montage 🐹🐶)
