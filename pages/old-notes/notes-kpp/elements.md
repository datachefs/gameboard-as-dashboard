## Elements the Game Board Needs to Include

 - A good balance between Leveling Up and taking care of my clients' daily needs
 - Keeping track of upcoming deadlines
 - Automating work/getting better at voice/getting better at hands almost every week

Separating out:  things I need to do today, things I want to do today, things I need to do in the next couple days, things I would like to accomplish this week

 - Keeping track of clients needs/questions I need to get to today/soon without being anxious about waiting to get to something, trying to keep what I need to do in my head or on a random scrap of paper
 - But also not insisting that everything I need to do today has to go in the electronic system; using paper for something that just came up

What Gordon said about focus -- maybe copy that over to here?
