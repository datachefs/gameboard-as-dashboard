P5 libraries:
- [Tramontana](https://tramontana.xyz): interactive stuff w mobiles
- [Scribble](https://github.com/generative-light/p5.scribble.js): sketchy

Built in 







It's pretty straightforward to give users a nice user interface for creating standard data visualizations. But what if you want to go beyond that? Creative Data Visualizations is a series of [Data Chefs]( https://datachefs.org/)' experiments to see if we can incrementally teach coding to folks who aren't developers.

## p5.js

[p5.js](https://p5js.org/) is a web-based JavaScript version of [Processing](https://processing.org/), "a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts."

My first DataViz experiments:

<!-- - The [simplest first program]](../pages/p5js/first-project/index.html); here's the [JavaScript](https://github.com/makersall/playful-coding/blob/main/pages/p5js/first-project/sketch.js) -->
 - Using [flowers](./p5js/flowers1/index.html) for a progress report
-  My  [playground](../pages/p5js/experiments.html), for taking baby steps to start teaching myself p5
  
_{NOTE: put copies of my DataViz experiments on the p5.js online editor/website}_
  
What p5.js can do:  
- [Klint](./p5js/klint/index.html), a clone of  [niccab](https://editor.p5js.org/niccab/sketches)'s replication of a Klint painting, to give you a feel for what a relatively small number of Processing commands can do ([JavaScript code](https://github.com/makersall/playful-coding/blob/main/pages/p5js/klint/sketch.js))
- Processing comes with a terrific set of [examples](https://p5js.org/examples/) that should give you an idea of what you can do; also check out the [reference](https://p5js.org/reference/) page for examples of how to use specific commands
- [Examples I've grabbed](../pages/p5js/examples.html) from around the web


To learn Processing, there are 2 ways to go:
- Use p5.js's [intro tutorials](https://p5js.org/learn/)
- Use the YouTube videos [for beginners with no coding experience](https://thecodingtrain.com/beginners/p5js/), courtesy of Daniel Shiffman's [Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/)
  
Processing has a truly amazing set of libraries, including:

-  a Nice [GUI library](https://github.com/bitcraftlab/p5.gui) â€” some really fun examples
- a better [animation framework](https://www.npmjs.com/package/p5.createloop)
- a [plotting library](https://github.com/jagracar/grafica.js), which also allows you to do lots of cool animations
- a library that lets you create shapes with a [Sketchy](https://github.com/generative-light/p5.scribble.js) look
- a crazy fun [sprite library](http://molleindustria.github.io/p5.play/)
- a nice [particle library](https://github.com/bobcgausa/cook-js)


You might also want to check out these [examples](http://jsfiddle.net/user/jagracar/fiddles/) as well as a series of experiments of doing [letters as particles](http://jsfiddle.net/bobcook/mph714p8/),
plus some fabulous examples from a [36 day challenge](https://36xp5.site).
