## Whimsy?

I want this stage to stage a play that gets me out of my head, that rips through loops of habit,   
that unravels the threads of anxiety and fear and re-weaves them into whimsy.   
   
That like reading Measure for Measure for the first time, forces me to slow down and pay attention, shifting my weight to a bedrock of whimsy and delight.   
   
(Okay, that's way over the top, but that's okay, just go with it)   
   
The biggest tiger I face is the one inside of me.   
I am being stalked,   
but not by an external, silent predator.   
The hairs on the back of my neck prick up   
not to subtle sounds warning of danger in the jungle,   
but to feelings that prowl under my skin.   
   
These big cats cannot be tamed or brought to heel.   
But can I find a way to befriend them?   
To join their pride   
and turn my fear to frisky play?   
   
   
This is good   
this feels right   
not perfect   
not even on target   
but exciting nonetheless.   
I am on the hunt!
