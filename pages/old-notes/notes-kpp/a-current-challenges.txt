# The Current Challenge

Why go with HTML, css and fun jpegs?
- Easier for other folks to build their own
- Most nonprofits have web designers on staff or they can hire
- A bunch of the work — playing w which icons, colors — don’t need to be skilled to do, fun to futz w, could leave rule tweaking to someone else once you’ve got all the rest set 

Allow for 2 Personal quest in progress queues — either add by hand/voice, or run a script each week from my personal desktop to sweep in the latest from TDist (store the pwd only on my desktop v of the code, maybe also encrypt it or something?)

- No to Google Sheets: easy way to store data, but coding there for these purposes is waaaay too hard
- Maybe ask that JS guy for easiest way of solving it?  
  - the data store part?
  - How to do a private / pwd protected server that’s as easy as possible — want to focus on JS/HTML/CSS code that’s easily portable and/or close to domain (so could easily switch from HTML to BJS or P5JS if goes beyond POC)

is there a light weight JavaScript data store that would work on a password protected site?
Could i use a private github site for that?  ￼￼

- what if I store it in one drive excel, so it's on the desktop/whatever?  
Yeah: fix it up online, then run to see
Or: in v0.5: use fun Ui to tweak, then copy and paste into onedrive excel or Google drive on desktop

V0.1: can play w it wo saving
Then ask JS guy simplest good way to do it
