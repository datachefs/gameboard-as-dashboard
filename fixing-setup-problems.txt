To run Jekyll with GitHub pages on your local box, a few pointers:

To set it up, follow the instructions on getting Jekyll set up:
https://jekyllrb.com/docs/, then click on Quickstart
(may also need:
https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll#creating-your-site
)

To fire up the Jekyll website, start of a command line, go to the directory containing the site, and type this:
bundle exec jekyll serve

If you get an error about webrick, try the following:
bundle add webrick

NOTE: if it complains about there not being a Gemfile, you may need to create a dummy site to get one. Create a new directory, and then type:
jekyll new --skip-bundle .
